CallBack
--------
-A Callback is a function that is passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.
-callback function is run inside of the function it was passed into.
-A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function,
 which contains the logic for when the callback function should be executed.

Callback hell
=============
-Callback hell will have multiple callbacks nested after each other. 
-It can happen when you do an asynchronous activity that’s dependent 
 on a previous asynchronous activity.
-Solutions to callback hell:
	1. Split functions into smaller functions.
	2. Using Promises.
	3. Using Async/await.



Promise
=======
-A promise is an object that holds the future value of an asynchronous operation.
-A Promise object represents a value that is not available now, but will be resolved/available at some point in the future.
-Promise object can have different states:- pending, resolved/fulfilled, rejected.
ex:-if we request some data from a server, promise promises us to get that data 
 that we can use in the future. 


ex: 
// fetch() returns a promise Object
let usersPromise= fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
console.log(usersPromise);

How to read data from a promise
-------------------------------
1. then()
2. async-await
