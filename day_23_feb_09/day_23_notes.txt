events Module
==============
-Emit custom events, listen custom event
-EventEmitter is a class
-emit() used to emit events
-on() used to listen events


CallStack
=========
-JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage execution contexts: the Global Execution Context and Function Execution Contexts.
-The call stack works based on the LIFO principle i.e., last-in-first-out.
-When we execute a script,JavaScript engine creates a Global Execution Context and pushes it on top of the call stack.
-Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a Function Execution Context for the function, pushes it on top of the Call Stack, and starts executing the function.
-If a function calls another function, the JavaScript engine creates a new Function Execution Context for the function that is being called and pushes it on top of the call stack.
-When the current function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack and resumes the execution where it left off in the last code listing.
-The script will stop when the call stack is empty.

-Macro tasks include keyboard events, mouse events, timer events, network events, Html parsing,
 changing Url etc. A macro task represents some discrete and independent work.
-Microtasks, are smaller tasks that update the application state and should be executed before
 the browser continues with other assignments such as re-rendering the UI. 
 Microtasks include promise callbacks and DOM mutation changes. Microtasks enable us to execute
 certain actions before the UI is re-rendered, thereby avoiding unnecessary UI rendering that
 might show an inconsistent application state.


Event Loop 
----------
-event loop is a constantly running process that coordinates the tasks between 
 call stack and callback queue to achieve concurrency.
-event loop monitors both the 'callback queue' and  'call stack'.
-If the callstack/executionstack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and 
	places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack. 
-If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen.

Node.js Streams
===============
-Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion.
-When we try to read a file, the contents of the file is read and all the content gets saved in memory
-Streams read chunks of data piece by piece, processing its content without keeping it all in memory.

-4 types of streams in Node.js:
1.Readable    fs.createReadStream()
2.writeable   fs.createWriteStream()
3.Duplex      net.Socket 
  A Duplex stream is both readable and writable, meaning it can consume input and produce output at the same time.
4.Transform


Piping the Streams:
-Piping is a mechanism where we provide the output of one stream as the input to another stream.
