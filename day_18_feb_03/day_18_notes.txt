Node.js fs module
=================
-The fs module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.
-There is no need to install it. Being part of the Node.js core, it can be used by simply requiring it. and have access to all its methods.

ex: 
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile(fileName [,options], callback)	Reads existing file.
fs.writeFile(filename, data[, options], callback)	Writes to the file. If file exists then overwrite the content otherwise creates new file.
fs.open(path, flags[, mode], callback)	Opens file for reading or writing.
fs.rename(oldPath, newPath, callback)	Renames an existing file.
fs.chown(path, uid, gid, callback)	Asynchronous chown.
fs.stat(path, callback)	Returns fs.stat object which includes important file statistics.
fs.link(srcpath, dstpath, callback)	Links file asynchronously.
fs.unlink(path, callback);	Delete a file.
fs.symlink(destination, path[, type], callback)	Symlink asynchronously.
fs.rmdir(path, callback)	Renames an existing directory.
fs.mkdir(path[, mode], callback)	Creates a new directory.
fs.readdir(path, callback)	Reads the content of the specified directory.
fs.utimes(path, atime, mtime, callback)	Changes the timestamp of the file.
fs.exists(path, callback)	Determines whether the specified file exists or not.
fs.access(path[, mode], callback)	Tests a user's permissions for the specified file.
fs.appendFile(file, data[, options], callback)	Appends new content to the existing file.


file encoding
=============
-Both fs.readFileSync() and fs.readFile() take an optional argument encoding. 
-while reading a file, a string will be returned if character encoding is specified.
-while reading a file, a buffer will be returned if character encoding is not specified.
ex: bufferData = fs.readFileSync("./customer.json");
	stringData = fs.readFileSync("./customer.json", "utf8");
Note: UTF-8 is an encoding system for Unicode. It can translate any Unicode character to a matching unique binary string.


HTTP Module
===========
-HTTP module can create an HTTP server.
-Receives the request from client & returns response back to the client.


-headers, URL, method and body data can be collected from request objects.
-Make routing decisions based on URL and/or other data in request objects.
-Send headers, HTTP status codes and response data via response objects.

createServer()   		Returns a new instance of Server.
listen(PORT,CallBack)   Binds the server to listen on a specific port
close()					Stops the server from listening to more requests

response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
response.writeHead() should be called first when initiating a response, allows 	us to set up the HTTP response code and headers we are sending back.

response.write(chunk[, encoding][, callback]) allows us to send a chunk of data as part of our response.

response.end() signalizes the response as complete, MUST be called once per response.


Note:Unless you change the path to your favicon in an HTML document, browsers will (usually) make a request to the /favicon.ico path in order to get the favicon of your server.


HTTP Methods
============
https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/

GET - Retrieve a resource/Retrieve data from DB
	  search	  
POST - to send data to server  ( sign up ) 
       (create a resource/create a new record in DB)
	   to fetch data securly    (send params in body not in URL)
PUT - update data/create or replace a resource  
	  update user's profile information 	  
PATCH - update/modify a particular resource(partial update)
        update user password
DELETE - Remove a resource/delete a record from DB 
		 Delete naukri account
OPTIONS - information about the Permitted HTTP methods (methods/content type)
       Identifying which HTTP methods a resource supports, e.g. can we DELETE it or update it via a PUT?
HEAD - method returns info about resource (http version/length/type)
	  used to request the headers of a resource without actually fetching the body of the resource.
	  HEAD request is a way to retrieve metadata about a resource, such as its size, modification date, or content type
