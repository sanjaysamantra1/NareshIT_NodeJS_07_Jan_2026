Functions
=========
1. Pre-Defined  / inbuilt
    -Functions are already written, we just have to use them
    -console.log(), document.write(), window.alert(), Math.max()
2. User-Defined 
    -We write the function logic and we use them




Functions
==========
1. Function Declaration / Named Functions
2. Function Expressions / anonymous
3. IIFE / Self Invoked Function 
4. Arrow Function (ES_6)


Function Declarations  vs Function Expressions
==============================================
-Function Declarations are named, Function Expressions are anonymous
-Function Declarations are hoisted, Function Expressions are anot hoisted


Self Invoked Function 
=====================
-these types of functions can be called only once
-to execute some logic only once during the page/application load


Arrow Function
===============
-ES_6   2015
-Concise Syntax
-implicit return
-no function keyword
-no body
-dont have their own 'this' binding


Arrow Function Limitations
===========================
-Arrow functions shouldn't be used as object methods.
-in Arrow functions 'this' is static, if we expect value of 'this' to be dynamic
 avoid arrow function.


 this
 ====
 Regular : this - how/where the function is called
 Arrow  : this - where the function is written, outer scope (lexical scope)
