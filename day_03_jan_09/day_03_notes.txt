Variables
=========
-Variables can be declared by using the below 3 keywords
    1. var
    2. let 
    3. const


        var                     let                         const
========================================================================
1. Since Begining          1. ECMAScript-6              1. ECMAScript-6
2. value can be changed    2. value can be changed      2. value cannt be changed
3. initialization - not    3. initialization-not        3. initialization - mandatory
4. can be re-declared      4. cann't be re-declared     4. cann't be re-declared
5. function/global         5. block/function/global     5. block/function/global
6. hoisting - yes          6. hoisting - yes            6. hoisting - yes
7. TDZ - No                7. TDZ - yes                 7. TDZ - yes

Variable Scope
==============
1. global : declared outside functions & accesible anywhere in the script 
2. function : declared inside a function and accessible anywhere in the function
3. block : declared inside a block and accessible only inside a block


Strict 
======
-in normal few mistakes are ignored
-in strict mode mistakes are converted to errors
-'use strict' enables strict mode

strcit checks:
-variable declaration without var/let/const is not allowed
-Duplicate parameter name not allowed



How Javascript Works
====================
-When a JavaScript program runs, 1 Global Execution Context (GEC) is created.
-For every function call, a new Function Execution Context (FEC) is created.
-Execution Context = the environment in which code executes.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Memory is allocated for variables and functions; 'var' variables are initialized with undefined)
	2. execution phase. (Code is executed line by line; variables receive their assigned values and functions are invoked)


Hoisting:
=========
-hoisting is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.
-Variables declared with var are hoisted, but their values are not initialized. They are given an initial value of undefined.
-Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but are not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError because they are in the "temporal dead zone."
-Function declarations are hoisted, meaning you can call them before they appear in the code.

Type			   Hoisted?			   Initialized?			  Usable before declaration?
=========================================================================================
var					✅ Yes				❌ Undefined			⚠️ Allowed but undefined
let					✅ Yes				❌ No					❌ ReferenceError
const				✅ Yes				❌ No					❌ ReferenceError
Func Declaration	✅ Yes				✅ Yes					✅ Allowed
Func Expression 	✅ Yes				❌ Undefined			❌ TypeError



Temporal Dead Zone
==================
-The period between entering scope and being initialized where they cannot be accessed. 
 This period is the temporal dead zone (TDZ).
-The state where variables are un-reachable. They are in memory, but they aren't usable.
-The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are initialized.
-if a let/const variable is accessed before its initialization, it would throw a ReferenceError. Because of the TDZ.
