How to Maintain multiple NodeJS versions
========================================
-NVM : Node version Manager
-NVM is a version manager for node.js
-Multiple nodeJS versions can be maintained with the help of NVM.
-It allows to easily switch the Node.js version.
  NVM for Mac - https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/
  NVM for windows - https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows


NVM useful commands
===================
-nvm help
 nvm
-Check NVM is installed
 nvm --version
-List all the available Node Versions to be installed
 nvm list available
-List all the installed Node Versions
 nvm list installed / nvm ls
-To install latest node version
 nvm install node
-To install a particular version of node
 nvm install 24.9.0
-To uninstall a particular version of node
 nvm uninstall 16.0.0
-To switch node version
 nvm use 16.0.0
-To check currently used node version
 nvm current / node -v


 NPM (Node Package Manager)
==========================
-npm is the standard package manager for NodeJS Applications.
-Node Package Manager (NPM) provides two main functionalities:
	1.Online repositories for node.js packages
	which are searchable on https://www.npmjs.com/
	2.Command line utility to install Node.js packages, do version management and dependency management of Node.js packages.
	
-NPM comes bundled with Node.js installables.
-To verify npm version, Run the below command  
 npm --version/-v
 
-initialize an NPM  project
 npm init
 npm init -y (everything default)


-Install a Module using npm
 npm install <Module Name>

-npm install 
 install all the modules as specified in package.json
 
-Install the package globally
 npm install <package_name> -g
 
-Save the package as dependency
 npm install <package_name> --save
 
-Save the package as dev-dependency
 npm install <package_name> --save-dev 
 
-Install the latest version of a package
 npm install <package_name>@latest
 
-Install any particluar version of a package
 npm install <package_name>@<version_number>
 npm install bootstrap@4.0.1
 
-Uninstalling Packages/Modules via NPM
 npm uninstall <package_name>

-check outdated packages
  npm outdated

-Audit for security issues
 npm audit
 npm audit fix
 
-Update Packages/Modules via NPM
 npm update <package_name>
 
-Searching a particular package
 npm search <package_name>
 
-List all Installed Packages Locally
 npm list/ls

-List all Installed Packages Globally
 npm ls -g
 
-Run a Script
 npm run <script-name>


npm i nodemon 			 	--> helps during development and production dependencies
npm i nodemon --save  		--> helps during development and production dependencies
npm i nodemon --save-dev  	--> helps during development not in production(-D)
npm i nodemon --no-save 	--> installs but does not add the entry to the package.json file dependencies
npm i nodemon --save-optional --> installs and adds the entry to the package.json file optionalDependencies
npm i --no-optional  --> will prevent optional dependencies from being installed





NPM Global vs Local Installation
================================
-By default, NPM installs any dependency in the local mode. 
-Local mode refers to the package installation in node_modules directory of our project.
-Locally installed packages are accessible via require() method. 
 ex: npm i minimist
    const minimist = require('minimist');
-Run the below command command to list down all the locally installed modules. 
 npm ls
-few packages that should be locally installed:
 1.minimist  2.express  3.lodash  4.bootstrap  5.axios  6.rxjs
-If a module needs to be used inside our code using require(), then install that module locally.
 
 
-Globally installed packages/dependencies are stored in system directory. 
-Such dependencies can be used in CLI (Command Line Interface), they are not meant to be imported using require() in Node application directly. 
 ex:- npm i nodemon -g
      const nodemon = require('nodemon'); //No
-Few packages that should be globally installed: 
 1.npm   2.nodemon  3.typescript  4.create-react-app  5.angular-cli  6.json-server
-Run the below command command to list down all the globally installed modules. 
 npm ls -g
-If we want to use a module in shell/command-prompt not using require(), install that globally.
 




yarn package Manager
====================
-Yarn is an open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. 
-It assists with the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages/dependencies

npm install -g yarn

yarn --version
yarn --help

yarn init -y
yarn add minimist
yarn add mocha --dev
yarn add minimist@latest
yarn add minimist@2.3.1
yarn install 
yarn install --production
yarn install --offline ( trigger an error if any required dependencies are not available in local cache)
yarn remove minimist
yarn upgrade <package>
yarn run [script-name]
yarn list
yarn outdated
yarn audit     (runs a security audit)






 
package.json
============
-Contains Project Metadata(name, version, author, description, scripts, main , dependencies)
-Helps NPM to understand how the project should be handled along with its dependencies.
-maintains version range (^ , ~)
-Nested Dependencies : No
-It's Created(tools) & maintained by Developers

package-lock.json
=================
-Automatically generated by npm when we install dependencies.
-Exact version of dependency
-Nested Dependencies : Yes
-The resolved URLs (npm registry or elsewhere)
-Ensures reproducible builds (everyone gets the same dependency versions)


package.json  VS  package-lock.json
===================================
-package.json maintains only the main packages's information.
 "cors": "^2.8.5"
 "bootstrap" : "^5.2.1"
-package-lock.json containes the exact version. 
	"bootstrap" : "5.3.2" (npm update bootstrap)
-package-lock.json maintains main packages's information + nested-packages information
    "node_modules/cors": {  
      "dependencies": {
        "object-assign": "^4",
        "vary": "^1"
      }
-package.json lists the required dependencies and their version ranges, but not the exact versions to be installed.
-package-lock.json is used to ensure that the same dependencies are installed across different environments and prevent conflicts due to different versions being installed.

-package.json is created and modified manually by the developer.
-It is automatically generated by npm and updated whenever we install or update packages.

-in package.json (~) tells go up to hot-fixes 1.4.X if 1.4.1 is installed
 in package.json (^) checks if there is a newer version under 1.x.x if 1.4.1 is installed
 in package-lock.json - there is neither ~ nor ^

Ex: bootstrap - 5.1.3
              major.minor.hotfix


NPX
===
NPX : Node Package Executer (used to execute Node.js packages)
-Run Packages without installing them.
-When you install NPM version 5.2.0 or higher, get NPX installed
-we can install npx using the below command
 npm i -g npx
-npx helps us avoid versioning, dependency issues and installing unnecessary packages that we just want to try out.
-npx helps running utility tools without installation (eslint, mocha)
 npx eslint .
 npx mocha
-ex:npx create-react-app my-sample-react-app
    npx nodemon file1.js	
	npx nodemon file1.js -y
