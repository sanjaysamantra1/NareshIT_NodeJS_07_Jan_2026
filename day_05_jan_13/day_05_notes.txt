Q. What is CallStack 
-Callstack is datastructure it keeps track of function calls in a javascript program.
-It follows Last In First Out Principle

Javascript uses callstack to 
-know which function is currently being executed
-where to return after a function finishes execution
-manages execution order

1. when a function is called, it is pushed to callstack
2. when a function finishes, it is popped out of the callstack
3. execution goes back to the previous place



Closure
=======
-A closure allows an inner function to remember variables from outer functions.
-A closure is created when an inner function remembers and continues to access variables from its outer function/lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished execution.

Note:
-closure is not created for outer functions.
-closure is created for inner functions, only if the inner function access outer function variable



Common Uses of closure
=======================
1. Data Encapsulation ( Private Varibales )
2. Function Factories

Encapsulation = Data Hiding + allow to access data through member functions
Function Factories : a function that creates and returns another function
